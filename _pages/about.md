I am a PhD student in [Linguistics](https://lin.ufl.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/)  at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) and an [Akan language instructor](https://africa.ufl.edu/academics-programs/african-languages/afli/instructors/) in the [Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures](https://languages.ufl.edu/). My research sits at the intersection of computational linguistics, language pedagogy, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for African languages.

As a researcher at the [Machine Learning for Endangered Language Documentation (MELD) Lab](https://meld.lin.ufl.edu/), I contribute to efforts that enhance the digital representation of low-resource languages. My work addresses the critical challenge of data scarcity, which limits the development of NLP models for understudied languages. By creating digital resources, improving linguistic annotation frameworks, and integrating machine learning techniques, I aim to make African languages more accessible in the digital age.

Beyond research, I am deeply involved in language education and preservation. As a native speaker of [Akan](https://languages.ufl.edu/academics/llc-languages/akan-studies/), I am passionate about ensuring that African languages are not only spoken but also thrive in digital spaces. I have taught Akan to diverse learners and contributed to [programs](https://africa.ufl.edu/academics-programs/african-languages/afli/) that promote linguistic and cultural immersion.

Through this website, I share insights into my research, academic projects, and the broader mission of bridging the gap between AI and language diversity. Feel free to explore and connect!
